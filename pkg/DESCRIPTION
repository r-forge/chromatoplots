Description: Provides a GUI-driven extensible pipeline-based framework for the 
  preprocessing of chromatography - mass spectrometry data with a strong
  emphasis on the use of interactive graphics for algorithm diagnostics. 
  The default pipeline is designed for GC-MS metabolomics data, but most 
  routines are likely applicable to other types of data. The pipeline may be 
  controlled from the command line or the GUI.
